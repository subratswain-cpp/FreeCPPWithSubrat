# TASK TO DO BEFORE NEXT SESSION 
# 5th OCT 2023
1. Enhance add_2_numbers.cpp program. As you know, for getting sum of 2 nos, we need to modify the values inside the program. Which is bit tedious work. SO we need to generalize our program and make it comfortable for the user. So we decided to follow the below requirement.

* ASK USER TO GIVE VALUE OF a & b.
Then Calculate the sum and print it on the screen.
(Hints: Use std::cin to take user input.)
Try it out. We will discuss in next session.
